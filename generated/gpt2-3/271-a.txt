A. Beautiful Year time limit per test 2 seconds memory limit per test 256 megabytes input stdin output stdout It seems like the year of 2013 came only yesterday. Do you know a curious fact? The year of 2013 is the first year after the old 1987 with only distinct digits. Now you are suggested to solve the following problem: given a year number, find the minimum year number which is strictly larger than the given one and has only distinct digits. Input The single line contains integer y (1000 ≤ y ≤ 9000) — the year number. Output Print a single integer — the minimum year number that is strictly larger than y and all it's digits are distinct. It is guaranteed that the answer exists. Examples Input 1987 Output 2013 Input 2013 Output 2014
