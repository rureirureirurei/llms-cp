Time-Based Activation Key

In modern software development, securing a product against unauthorized distribution is as important as creating and selling it. A common method for software protection is the use of activation keys. Traditionally, these keys are static, meaning they remain constant for a given product. However, the company "Gold&Silver Soft" has introduced a dynamic activation key system, where the key changes every minute based on a specific rule.

The key at any given minute is a positive integer. If the current key is N, the key for the next minute is calculated as:
N' = N + S(N)
where S(N) is the checksum of N, defined as the number of ones in the binary representation of N.

For example, if N = 6, its binary representation is 110₂, which contains 2 ones. Thus, the next key value is:
N' = 6 + 2 = 8

Input:
A single integer N (1 ≤ N ≤ 2×10⁹) is provided in the input file "INPUT.TXT."

Output:
Print a single integer to the output file "OUTPUT.TXT," representing the activation key value for the next minute.

Example:
Input:
2
Output:
3

Input:
6
Output:
8

Input:
27
Output:
31
