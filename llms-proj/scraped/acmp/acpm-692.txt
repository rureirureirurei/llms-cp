Amber Trade Deals  

In the country of Amber, trade and financial relationships are highly complex. When two merchants wish to exchange goods, they must go to the Amber Trade Guild. However, a direct exchange is not possible unless their *normalization coefficients* match. Only in such cases can the Trade Guild profit from the deal.  

A merchant's normalization coefficient is calculated based on their age **N** and the numeral system base **P** used in their country. The coefficient is defined as the sum of the digits of **N** when expressed in base **P**.  

The task is to determine how much the Trade Guild will earn when two merchants attempt a trade. If their normalization coefficients match, the profit equals this common value; otherwise, the guild earns nothing.  

Input:  
The input file "INPUT.TXT" contains two lines.  
- The first line has two integers: **N1** and **P1**, representing the first merchant's age and numeral system base.  
- The second line has two integers: **N2** and **P2**, representing the second merchant's age and numeral system base.  

Constraints:  
0 ≤ N1, N2 ≤ 2147483647  
2 ≤ P1, P2 ≤ 16  

Output:  
The output file "OUTPUT.TXT" should contain a single integer, representing the Trade Guild's earnings from the deal.
