Squaring Numbers Ending in 5  

Vasya and Petya study in the same school class. Recently, Petya taught Vasya a clever trick for squaring natural numbers that end in the digit 5. With this method, Vasya can easily square two-digit and some three-digit numbers ending in 5.  

The trick works as follows:  
To square a number ending in 5, remove the last digit (5), multiply the remaining number by its successor, and then append "25" to the result.  

For example, to square 125:  
1. Remove the last digit → 12  
2. Multiply it by its next number → 12 * 13 = 156  
3. Append "25" → 15625  

Thus, 125² = 15625.  

Input:  
A single natural number **A** ending in 5 is provided in the input file "INPUT.TXT". The value of **A** does not exceed **400000**.  

Output:  
Print the squared value of **A** in the output file "OUTPUT.TXT" without leading zeros.  

Example:  
Input:  
5  
Output:  
25  

Input:  
75  
Output:  
5625
