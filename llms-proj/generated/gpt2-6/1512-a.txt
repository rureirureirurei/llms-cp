A. Spy Detected! time limit per test 2 seconds memory limit per test 256 megabytes input standard input output standard output You are given an array $$$a$$$ consisting of $$$n$$$ ($$$n \ge 3$$$) positive integers. It is known that in this array, all the numbers except one are the same (for example, in the array $$$[4, 11, 4, 4]$$$ all numbers except one are equal to $$$4$$$). Print the index of the element that does not equal others. The numbers in the array are numbered from one. Input The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 100$$$). Then $$$t$$$ test cases follow. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$3 \le n \le 100$$$) — the length of the array $$$a$$$. The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \le a_i \le 100$$$). It is guaranteed that all the numbers except one in the $$$a$$$ array are the same. Output For each test case, output a single integer — the index of the element that is not equal to others. Example Input 4
